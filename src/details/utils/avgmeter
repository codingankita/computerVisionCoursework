This code defines a class named `AverageMeter`, which is used to compute and store the average and current value. The class is designed to be used in a training loop, where it keeps track of the progress of the training process. The `AverageMeter` class has the following methods:

- `__init__`: This method initializes the `AverageMeter` instance and calls the `reset` method.
- `reset`: This method resets the `val`, `avg`, `sum`, and `count` attributes to zero.
- `update`: This method updates the `val`, `sum`, and `count` attributes with the given values. The `n` argument specifies the number of samples contributing to the value `val`.

The purpose of this class is to keep track of the running average of some metric over the course of a training process. For example, during training of a neural network, we may want to keep track of the running average of the loss over the training data. At each iteration, we compute the loss for a batch of training examples and update the `AverageMeter` instance with the computed loss. At the end of the epoch, the `avg` attribute of the `AverageMeter` instance gives us the average loss over the training data for that epoch.
